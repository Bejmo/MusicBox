# MusicBox  
**(Android app experiment to download music using yt-dlp and Python)**

This project is a simple attempt to create an Android app that downloads music via YouTube playlists. It uses Python and yt-dlp. Due to permission restrictions in the Play Store version of Termux, I didnâ€™t finish the full app with a proper interface. However, you *can* run the Python script in Termux to download music.

## How does it work?  
- All the core Python files are located in the `/modules` folder (other files can be ignored). Run the script by executing `main.py`.
- Music is downloaded into a folder named `/AIMP` located at the same directory level as `/modules`.  
  - If you download a playlist, it creates a folder with the playlistâ€™s name inside `/AIMP`.
  - If the playlist was downloaded before, it will try to find and download only new songs, updating the playlist folder.
  - **Note:** The folder is named **AIMP** because that's the music player I use, but you can rename it to whatever you prefer.
- When you run the script, simply provide the URL of the YouTube playlist, and it will download or update the music accordingly.
  - Update the playlist means:
    - It deletes all the local songs that are no longer in the playlist
    - It downloads the songs that are not in local but in the playlist.
- Example folder structure (if you put the project inside your `Downloads` folder):
downloads/
â”œâ”€â”€ AIMP    # All downloaded music
â””â”€â”€ modules # Python source files
- Note: The name of the files has the video id. That's because, if two songs have the same name, the program may fail updating the playlist.

## Requirements  
- The YouTube playlist **must be at least Unlisted** (Private playlists will cause the program to fail).  
- It's recommended to manually remove unavailable videos from the playlist to avoid delays during downloading.

## How to use it on your mobile device (with Termux)

1. Install **Termux** from the Play Store.

2. Open Termux and paste the next 4 commands
```bash
termux-setup-storage
```
```bash
pkg install git
```
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bejmo/MusicBox.git
```
```bash
sh ./MusicBox/modules/install.sh
```

3. Reboot **Termux** and you will be able to execute the scrit by just typing `yt` on **Termux**.

## Known issues & future improvements

- **Unavailable videos in playlists:** These need to be removed manually for smoother operation. You can find a list of problematic videos in `error_logs_not_saved.txt` (after you execute the script).
- **Album art may be missing:** Sometimes the metadata (including cover art) isnâ€™t properly saved on some files (if the portrait is not downlaoded, you can see the missing song in `error_logs_not_saved.txt`).
- **Update functionality:** Currently, the script only adds new songs from the playlist but does not remove files that no longer exist in the playlist. I'd like to add this feature in the future.
